# UserAuth
This project is a user authentication and feedback system built in PHP. It allows users to sign up using their email and password, which are securely stored in a database managed by PHPMyAdmin. After signing up, users can log in; if they enter an incorrect password, an error message is displayed. Upon successful login, users are welcomed to a page with two options: register or provide feedback. Registration involves filling out a form, and the data is saved to a database table, with a success message confirming the entry. Users can also submit feedback, which is stored in a separate feedback table. If users try to register again, their previously entered details are displayed, preventing duplicate entries. Users can update their feedback, with changes reflected in the database and a confirmation message shown. The system ensures seamless and secure user management and feedback collection.
